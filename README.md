Climate communication plays a central role in shaping public understanding of environmental issues, particularly during high-profile moments like the annual COP conferences. Leaders often adopt an optimistic, forward-looking tone to galvanize public support and signal momentum. Yet audiences do not always respond in the same emotional register. Understanding how people actually receive and react to these messages can reveal important gaps in trust, engagement, and expectations surrounding climate policy.

This project examines that gap by comparing the sentiment of Prince William’s COP30 speech with public reactions in the YouTube comment section of the same video. Using a workflow that pairs text collection (via Whisper transcription and the YouTube Data API) with VADER sentiment analysis and TF-IDF keyword extraction, the project explores how institutional optimism contrasts with the more cautious tone of online discourse. This serves as a small case study of how climate messaging lands with the public.
